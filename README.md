# ATAR-taxcomplexity
Data and Stata do-files to reproduce the results in the paper "How the Introduction of Anti-Tax Avoidance Rules Affects Tax Complexity"

The data and do-files are structured along the anti-tax avoidance rules investigated in the paper. E.g., the do-file "CFC-regressions" uses the data "CFCdata" and provides for all analyses concerning CFC rules.

Nervertheless, many variables in all analyses across anti-tax avoidance rules are the same, as described in the paper. The Excel-file "Overview_Variables" gives an overview aover all variable names, descriptions and sources.
