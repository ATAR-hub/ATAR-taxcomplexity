# ATAR-taxcomplexity
Data and Stata do-files to reproduce the results in the paper "How the Introduction of Anti-Tax Avoidance Rules Relates to Tax Complexity"
The data and do-files are structured along the anti-tax avoidance rules investigated in the paper. For example, the do-file "CFC-regressions" uses the data "CFCdata" and provides this data for all analyses on CFC rules.
The variables for other anti-tax avoidance rules follow this pattern as described in our study. The Excel-file "Overview_Variables" provides an overview of all variable names, descriptions, and sources.
